# Lead-Scoring_Case-Study
This case study revolves around assisting X Education, an educational firm, in enhancing its lead conversion rate. This entails building a logistic regression model to score leads, targeting an 80% conversion rate.
## Problem Statement:

X Education, an education provider, offers online courses tailored to industry professionals. Each day, numerous professionals visit their website to explore available courses. 

The company promotes its courses on various websites and search engines like Google. Visitors to the website may browse courses, fill out forms, or watch videos. Providing contact information marks them as leads. Additionally, referrals also generate leads. The sales team then contacts these leads via calls or emails. While some leads convert, the majority do not. X Education's average lead conversion rate stands at approximately 30%.

While X Education receives numerous leads, its conversion rate is notably low. For instance, out of 100 daily leads, only around 30 convert. To enhance efficiency, the company aims to pinpoint "Hot Leads" with high conversion potential. By prioritizing these leads, the sales team can focus efforts more effectively, potentially increasing the overall conversion rate.

Many leads are generated initially, but only a small portion become paying customers. Effective nurturing of potential leads in the middle stage, involving education about the product and consistent communication, is crucial for achieving a higher lead conversion rate.

X Education has tasked you with identifying the most potential leads, those likely to convert into paying customers. Your objective is to develop a model assigning lead scores, where higher scores indicate a greater chance of conversion. The CEO aims for an approximate 80% target conversion rate.

## Goals of the Case Study
This case study has a few objectives:

Develop a logistic regression model to allocate lead scores ranging from 0 to 100 for each lead. These scores will assist the company in identifying potential leads, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of conversion, while lower scores suggest a lower probability of conversion.

Certainly, I understand the additional requirement to handle potential future changes in the company's requirements. I will use the logistic regression model to address the problems presented in the separate document and ensure that the model remains flexible to adapt to any changes. This will be incorporated into the final PowerPoint presentation along with recommendations.
